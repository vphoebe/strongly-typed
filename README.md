# strongly-typed

a type chart and calculator for a kids jrpg

- enter the pokemon you're fighting and see dual-type calculations
- accounts for type changes across generations, and abilities that nullify types (like levitate)
- uses static data fetched from the lovingly maintained [PokeAPI](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi)
